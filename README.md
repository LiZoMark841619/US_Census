# US_Census

This is a Data Cleaning Project for practice purposes. 

The main goal is to make assumptions and statements regarding the races living in every state of the US.
I used the most common libs such as matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, numpy, seaborn, re, and glob.

The main tasks were to transform data into a readable and useable form in order to work effectively with them and to be able to manipulate and analyze them.
